    "# Lab: SVMs on Extended MNIST\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [MNIST demo](../Demos/demo_mnist_svm.ipynb), we saw how SVMs can be used for the classic problem of MNIST digit recognition. In this lab, we are going to extend the MNIST dataset by adding a number of non-digit letters and see if the classifier can distinguish the digits from the non-digits. All non-digits will be lumped as a single 11-th class. This is a highly simplified version of a 'detection' problem (as opposed to 'classification' problem). Detection is vital in OCR and related problems since the non useful characters must be rejected. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the concepts in the demo, you will learn:\n",
    "* Combine multiple datasets\n",
    "* Select the SVM parameters (`C` and `gamma`) via cross-validation.\n",
    "* Use the `GridSearchCV` method to search for parameters with cross-validation.\n"
